My goal is to develop a personal AI personal assistant with a comprehensive mix between personality levels like Neuro-sama (not traits), hyper intelligence and data scanning, and being able to switch systems through networks and IOT whenever, while using NASA’s Power of 10 rules for developing safety critical code, because I can control the structure and auditability easier without a slog of debugging at every step. 

## Usage
run 'main.py' with Python 3.8+ and use 'Facts.txt' input file, for now

## Requirements
Standard Library so far. No external packages needed.

## Notes

This project was designed around NASA's Power of 10 Safety Standards

Biomimetic Spinal Cord Design (Event-Driven, Full Integration, Expanded)


---

1. High-Level Structure

The spinal cord module mimics real physiology while staying efficient:

Dorsal root → sensory input (afferents).

Dorsal horn → integration + thresholding.

Reflex circuits → fast loops for survival.

Ventral horn → motor pools (efferents).

Ventral root → symbolic motor actions.

Ascending pathways → copies to higher centers.

Integration stubs → placeholders for brain modules.

Scheduler → event-driven, only runs when spikes occur.



---

2. Event-Driven Scheduler

Keeps a priority queue of (time, priority, fn, args).

Idle baseline, bursts only when events fire.


def schedule(time_ms, priority, fn, *args):
    # Insert into queue
    event_q.push((time_ms, priority, fn, args))

def run_until(t_stop):
    while queue_not_empty and next_event.time <= t_stop:
        t, pri, fn, args = pop_next_event()
        fn(t, *args)   # fire the event handler


---

3. Sensory Afferents (Dorsal Root Fibers)

A-β: touch/pressure.

Ia/II: muscle spindle (length/velocity).

Ib: Golgi tendon (force/tension).

A-δ: fast sharp pain (15 m/s).

C: slow dull pain (1 m/s).


Conduction modeled by distance / velocity → ms delay.

def afferent_fire(fiber, distance_cm, weight, target):
    velocity = fiber_velocity[fiber]   # e.g. Aδ=15 m/s
    delay_ms = (distance_cm/100)/velocity * 1000
    schedule(now + delay_ms, 0, target, weight, fiber)


---

4. Dorsal Horn (Integration)

Uses leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) style neurons.

Only crosses threshold when stimulus is strong enough.

Generates symbolic reflex triggers.


if signal.type == "pain":
    if nociceptor.integrate(weight=signal.intensity):
        return {"reflex":"withdraw", "fiber":"Aδ", "severity":"high"}
elif signal.type == "touch":
    if mechanoreceptor.integrate(weight=signal.intensity):
        return {"reflex":"light_contact", "fiber":"Aβ", "severity":"low"}


---

5. Nociception (Pain Specialization)

Fast A-δ pain → instant withdrawal.

Slow C pain → delayed, persistent, limbic tagging.

Wind-up: repeated C input within window → amplify severity.


if fiber == "C":
    c_event_log.append(now)
    if len(events_within(1500_ms)) >= 5:
        reflex["severity"] = "high"   # wind-up effect


---

6. Ventral Horn (Motor Pools)

Pools of α-motor neurons grouped per action.

Each action = redundant neurons for smooth firing.


motor_pools = {
  "withdraw_arm": ["alpha1","alpha2","alpha3"],
  "flex_leg": ["alpha4","alpha5"]
}

def trigger_action(reflex_cmd):
    return {"action": reflex_cmd, "neurons_fired": motor_pools.get(reflex_cmd, [])}


---

7. Reflex Circuits (Core Loops)

Stretch reflex: spindle → α agonist.

Reciprocal inhibition: antagonist suppressed.

Golgi tendon reflex: too much force → agonist inhibited.

Withdrawal reflex: flexor excite, extensor inhibit.

Crossed extensor reflex: contralateral extensor excite.

Renshaw cells: α collateral → inhibition of same pool to stop runaway bursts.


if reflex == "withdraw":
    excite("flexor_pool")
    inhibit("extensor_pool")          
    excite("contralateral_extensors") 
    renshaw_feedback("flexor_pool")   # recurrent inhibition


---

8. Ascending Pathways

Always forward a copy of input + reflex upward.

Adds fiber metadata for context.


forward = {
  "to_thalamus": original_signal,
  "reflex_copy": reflex,
  "fiber": reflex.get("fiber","unknown")
}


---

9. Integration Stubs

Symbolic placeholders to wire into future modules:

ThalamusStub: logs reception.

BrainstemStub: survival-level regulation.

CerebellumStub: fine-tunes motor outputs.

LimbicStub: tags pain with emotions.

PFCStub: allows voluntary override.

OccipitalStub / AuditoryStub: orienting reflexes.


class LimbicStub:
    def tag_emotion(self, pain_signal):
        return {"emotion":"fear", "source":pain_signal}


---

10. Audit & Logging

Each event written to AuditLoggerFactory:

Timestamp

Fiber type & delay

Reflex type

Motor pool output

Ascending copies + emotional tags


logger.log({
  "t": now,
  "fiber": "Aδ",
  "reflex": "withdraw",
  "motor_pool": ["alpha1","alpha2"],
  "ascending": ["thalamus","limbic"],
  "emotion": "fear"
})


---

11. Biomimetic Efficiency Principles

Always alive, rarely active — idle ionic baseline until input arrives.

Event-driven — compute only on spikes/reflexes.

Delays & refractory periods — natural timing + reduced compute.

Procedural reflex rules — symbolic state machines instead of dense sim.

Integration stubs — allow future modules to expand without rewriting.



Addendum: Reflex Timing (A-δ vs C fibers)

Fast Pain (A-δ fiber)

Stimulus: pinprick to finger.

Conduction: ~15 m/s, distance 1 m → ~67 ms delay.

Dorsal horn: threshold crossed quickly → reflex generated.

Ventral horn: flexor pool fires → withdrawal before brain notices.

Ascending copy: thalamus & limbic receive context within ~100 ms total.


Pseudo-code timing sketch:

afferent_fire("Aδ", distance=100, weight=80, target=dorsal_horn)  
# ~67 ms later → dorsal_horn triggers withdrawal reflex
# reflex_arc completes + ascending copy sent ~100 ms


---

Slow Pain (C fiber)

Stimulus: burn to hand.

Conduction: ~1 m/s, distance 1 m → ~1000 ms delay.

Dorsal horn: slow arrival, weaker signal, but sustained.

Ventral horn: reflex may still fire, but delayed & weaker.

Ascending copy: limbic tagging stronger (“fear/ache”), arrives much later.


Pseudo-code timing sketch:

afferent_fire("C", distance=100, weight=60, target=dorsal_horn)  
# ~1000 ms later → dorsal_horn processes
# reflex delayed, limbic tagging amplified


---

Key Takeaway

A-δ fibers = sharp, immediate withdrawal → ~0.1 sec.

C fibers = dull, aching pain → ~1 sec or more, adds emotional weight.

Full logging for audit and override.


Nervous System Junctions Plan

(for integration with spinal cord stubs)

1. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) Split

Somatic nerves (voluntary): link muscles & skin → spinal cord via dorsal/ventral roots.

Autonomic nerves (involuntary): split into sympathetic / parasympathetic trunks.

Stub structure:

somatic_stub.py → takes in sensory/motor events outside CNS.

autonomic_stub.py → takes relay from spinal cord and routes toward ganglia.

2. Sympathetic Chain Ganglia (fight/flight relay)

Connected to spinal cord via ventral root + rami.

Junction that boosts signal intensity, redirects to heart, lungs, pupils, etc.

Stub: sympathetic_chain_stub.py

receive_from_spinal(signal)

amplify_and_forward(targets)

3. Parasympathetic Ganglia (rest/digest relay)

Mostly cranial & sacral outputs.

Opposite effect: down-regulates, calms, routes to gut, glands, bladder.

Stub: parasympathetic_ganglia_stub.py

receive_from_spinal(signal)

dampen_and_forward(targets)

4. Enteric Nervous System (gut brain)

Semi-independent but loops into parasympathetic.

Symbolically modeled as its own stub for digestion reflexes.

Stub: enteric_stub.py

process_digestive(signal)

Forwards status back to spinal cord or brainstem.

5. Cranial Nerve Junctions

Not all route through spinal cord, but you should leave connectors.

For now, stub the important ones that matter for “body routing”:

Optic nerve stub → forwards to occipital.

Auditory nerve stub → forwards to temporal.

Vagus nerve stub → ties into parasympathetic.

6. Brainstem Autonomic Centers

Already stubbed in your spinal cord plan, but now add outputs to autonomic ganglia.

Stub: brainstem_autonomic_stub.py

coordinate_heartbeat

coordinate_breathing

Forwards instructions to sympathetic/parasympathetic stubs.

7. Motor Endplates (muscle junctions)

Final junction for efferent pathways.

Each motor neuron pool in ventral horn should stub to a neuromuscular_stub.py.

Example:

trigger_contraction(muscle, strength)

8. Sensory End Organs

Match dorsal horn inputs: nociceptors, mechanoreceptors, thermoceptors, proprioceptors.

Each gets its own stub to simulate peripheral detection.

Example stubs:

skin_sense_stub.py

joint_proprio_stub.py

pain_receptor_stub.py

🔗 Integration Strategy

All these stubs should be glued onto the spinal cord via ascending/descending signal classes you already have.

Each stub only needs to print/log right now (like your thalamus/limbic stubs do).

When you expand later, you just swap the stub body for real processing logic.
