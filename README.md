My goal is to develop a personal AI personal assistant with a comprehensive mix between personality levels like Neuro-sama (not traits), hyper intelligence and data scanning, and being able to switch systems through networks and IOT whenever, while using NASAâ€™s Power of 10 rules for developing safety critical code, because I can control the structure and auditability easier without a slog of debugging at every step. 

## Usage
run 'main.py' with Python 3.8+ and use 'Facts.txt' input file, for now

## Requirements
Standard Library so far. No external packages needed.

## Notes
This project was designed around NASA's Power of 10 Safety Standards
